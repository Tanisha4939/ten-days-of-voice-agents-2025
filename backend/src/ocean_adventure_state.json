    "description": "You wake on the pale sands of a crescent-shaped island, waves glowing faint blue in the pre-dawn light. Far out at sea, the silhouette of a leaning lighthouse rises from a jagged reef, its lantern long dark. To your right, a narrow path winds toward a small fishing village built on stilts over the water. Half-buried near your hand lies a barnacle-crusted shell box, washed up by the tide.",
